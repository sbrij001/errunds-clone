Errunds is revolutionizing the way we shop in-store today by better connecting busy shoppers with local brick and mortars in the community. In-short it is disrupting retail. A lot of the concept hedges on having a product that offers a stunning UI and very easy to utilize UX for the end users; shoppers and brick and mortar businesses. 
The following assessment is a micro part of the concept-MVP that we have/ will launch next month (august). The working-MVP will be a continuation of this MVP and would be launched in September so this assessment is basically a kickstart to the MVP. The questions are also targeted to test your skill set on our techstack and abilities that we are looking for. See attached prototype screenshots in reference to relative questions.
